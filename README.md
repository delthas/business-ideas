# delthas' business ideas

Since a company is 1% idea / 99% execution, here is my public domain list of business ideas I have.

## Paid mobile app for virtual tours/audioguide in a city

You're visiting Paris, walking in the streets of a particular neighborhoood. You open the app and start a virtual guided tour of the area. You keep your phone in your pocket, and simply listen to the tour through your headphones, just like a museum audio guide.

The app would have multiple tours, each with:
- a map (itinerary of the virtual tour, point of interests, + your position)
- an audio guide (with chapters, easy playback/pause/...)

The different items of the audio tour could be automatically started as you reach the right area (obtained by phone GPS).

> Here's a nice building [...] Continue straight ahead, then turn right on Rue Charmand.
> [person walks, then reaches the next point of interest]
> Rue Charmand was first built in 1234...

Two choices:
- Free app, crowdsourced tours, sorted by public review rating, ads-based.
- Paid app, curated tours made by the company or through partnership with the city/..., no ads. I prefer this solution and think that an initial small investment of a dozen tours (~1 hour each) in eg Paris could make the app popular while keeping costs small.

This could probably be financed by the state/city as well.

## Paid foodie app with curated reviews

Google Maps meets the Michelin restaurant guide.

Crowdsourced restaurant reviews like Google Maps are bad:
- People not rating based on objective criteria (I had a great time so I will give a good rating)
- People not experienced in tasting (first time tasting Chinese food, I loved it!!)
- Restaurants maliciously introducing bias ("rate my place 5 stars", or even "rate my place 5 stars and you'll get a discount")
- People not using the rating range properly (almost always 4 or 5 stars, instead of a gaussian)

On the other end, the Michelin restaurant guide has its own issues:
- Very few restaurants referenced
- Rates service as importantly as food
- Lacks metadata, misc information about the restaurant
- Only focused on high-end restaurants

Traditional paper guides (LonelyPlanet, ...) are not well designed for phone usage and curate way too few restaurants. This is not their main area of focus anyways.

Introducting a middle ground: a paid app with expert restaurant curators for popular, affordable food:
- Small community of restaurant reviewers (could be either paid employees, or (lowly-)paid trusted users of the app, or through partnerships)
- Reviewers always add relevant metadata (menu, price range, type, time spent, vegetarian?, noisy?, cosy service?, ...)
- Reviewers give reviews on a normal scale (from 0 to 10, 5 being average), with objective crtieria (food taste (main focus!!), location, service)

The end goal would be to typically have ~5% to ~20% restaurants in big cities covered.

The app could have some interesting features:
- remembering your tastes, to showcase soome particular food types over others
- filter closed restaurants/*restaurants that will be closed by the time you arrive* (no app currently does this)
- advanced criteria depending on the situation (mid-end & cosy service for a date, high-end & french for a day out with grandma, cheap & asian for some street food with friends)

This could probably be financed by ads for the resturants that have a good review.

This could arguably grow later into a collaboration for managing the online presence of the restaurant.

## Happy news

More and more news are about negative events. They are negative due to their nature of being instantaneous (a school can get destroyed in a day, so that's an event, but increasing literacy over 50 years is not a event).

On the other hand, people (and the young specifically) are getting anxious due to hearing this kind of news all day. Many of them have stopped listening to the news to avoid feeling sad or anxious about their future, have stopped taking part in the public life of politics etc. A new tendancy of "safe spaces" is rising.

Introducing a "happy news" outlet, providing only positive articles about how our world has got better recently or over the past.

Example articles (fictional) could be:
- a report by the French government shows that literacy has increased from 95% to 98% over the last 20 years thanks to [...]
- the endangered purple tiger species, previously reduced to life in captivity only, was successfully reintroduced in the African Savannah, with 3 baby tigers birthed in nature; giving hopes for similar operations in the future
- yearly mass CO2 emissions have finally started to decrease, after a two hundred year increase, [...]

This could just be an outlet filtering/relaying positive news from other websites.

Target audience would probably be younger people, so short articles and accounts on social media would be great.

Financed by ads, or maybe some state funding.
